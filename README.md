# Walkable-Cities
Evaluate walkability of cities using Python by assessing its associated characteristics and exploring the correlation between crime rates based on a dataset containing walk scores of cities across the United States.

This scatterplot tracks the approximate number of criminal offenses known to law enforcement per person in a given city, across the 25 most populated cities in the United States, compared to its corresponding walk score. Surprisingly enough, crime rate appears to be positively correlated to walk score, implying that crime rate tends to increase with a cityâ€™s walkability. It can be deduced that the more walkable a city is, the more frequently people will walk outside, which attracts more opportunity for crime.
